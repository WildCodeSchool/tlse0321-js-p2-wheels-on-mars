      Crater and acquires rock, soil, and air samples for onboard analysis. The
      car-size rover is about as tall as a basketball player and uses a 7
      foot-long arm to place tools close to rocks selected for study. Curiositys
      large size allows it to carry an advanced kit of 10 science instruments.
      It has tools including 17 cameras, a laser to vaporize and study small
      pinpoint spots of rocks at a distance, and a drill to collect powdered
      rock samples. It hunts for special rocks that formed in water and/or have
      signs of organics.

      Curiosity carries the biggest, most advanced instruments for scientific
      studies ever sent to the Martian surface. The history of Martian climate
      and geology is written in the chemistry and structure of the rocks and
      soil. Curiosity reads this record by analyzing powdered samples drilled
      from rocks. It also measures the chemical fingerprints present in
      different rocks and soils to determine their composition and history,
      especially their past interactions with water.

      Mars Science Laboratory arrived at Mars through technological innovations
      that tested a completely new landing method. The spacecraft descended on a
      parachute, then during the final seconds before landing, the landing
      system fired rockets to allow it to hover while a tether lowered Curiosity
      to the surface. The rover landed on its wheels, the tether was cut, and
      the landing system flew off to crash-land a safe distance away.

      The Mars Science Laboratory mission represents a huge step in Mars
      exploration because it has: Demonstrated the ability to land a very large,
      heavy rover to the surface of Mars Demonstrated the ability to land more
      precisely in a 12.4-mile (20-kilometer) landing area Demonstrated
      long-range mobility on Mars for studying diverse environments and
      analyzing samples found in different settings.
